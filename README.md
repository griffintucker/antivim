to be pasted into a terminal or otherwise executed from within the gui

supports gui selection of files, drag and drop, and optionally, suggestions based on scouring open windows/files, and file managers

naming comes from vim, a popular text editor that prides itself on it's lack of mouse cursor compatiblity; antivim is it's opposite
